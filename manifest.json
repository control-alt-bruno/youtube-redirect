  "description": "This extension modifies the behavior of the YouTube logo to automatically redirect users to the subscriptions page. This is especially useful for those who want to maintain their privacy and not share their watch history, preventing YouTube's homepage from displaying algorithm-based recommendations. Without this extension, the YouTube homepage may become a blank screen if watch history is disabled. With the extension enabled, users will see videos from the channels they follow, regaining control over their content and protecting their personal information.",
